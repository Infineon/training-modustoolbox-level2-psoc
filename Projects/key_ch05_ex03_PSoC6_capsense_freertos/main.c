/******************************************************************************
* File Name: main.c
*
* Description: This code example features a 5-segment CapSense slider and two
*              CapSense buttons. Button 0 turns the LED ON, Button 1 turns the
*              LED OFF, and the slider controls the brightness of the LED. The
*              code example also features interfacing with Tuner GUI using I2C
*              interface.
*
*              This code example uses FreeRTOS. For documentation and API
*              references of FreeRTOS, visit : https://www.freertos.org
