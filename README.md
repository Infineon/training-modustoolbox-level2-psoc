# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – PSoC™ MCUs

This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers PSoC™ 6 and PSoC™ 4 MCUs.

The material and examples demonstrate the use of peripherals such as GPIOs, PWMs, ADCs,
UARTs, etc. CAPSENSE™ and DMA are covered in detail, as is the use of low power modes and dual core.

## Pre-requisites

- ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 1 - Getting Started

## Organization

- *Manual*:    This directory contains the manual chapters.
- *Projects*:  This directory contains solutions to exercises.
- *Templates*: This directory contains starting template applications for some exercises.

## Manual Chapters

This class consists of 7 chapters:
- Chapter 1: Introduction - Overall introduction to PSoC™ devices
- Chapter 2: Peripherals - Description of the PDL and HAL middleware, how to use them to interact with PSoC™ peripherals
- Chapter 3: RTOS - Introduction to using an RTOS with PSoC™
- Chapter 4: CAPSENSE - Description of Infineon's CAPSENSE™ solution, how to use CAPSENSE™ tools and middleware
- Chapter 5: Low-Power - Description of PSoC™ low power, how to use low power modes
- Chapter 6: DMA - Description of PSoC™ Direct Memory Access, how to use DMA
- Chapter 7: Dual Core - Learn about dual core applications on PSoC 6 and inter-process communication
- Chapter 8: Supplementary Material - Additional background electronics information

## Hardware

The following hardware is used for the exercises in this class:

- CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 (PSoC™ 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit)
- CY8CKIT-149 (PSoC™ 4100S Plus Prototyping Kit)
- CY8CKIT-028-TFT (TFT Display Shield Board)(optional)
- Ammeter (for low power chapter exercises)

## Videos

Videos are available for many of the topics from this class. See the list below for links to the videos.

| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [How-To: Starting with a new application](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=CCBLCmsjnWMTHiK2Y-FAEZ&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | In this video we walk through creating a new application based off of the PSoC™ 6 Empty Application template. The video showcases both the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox™ and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. This How-To segment will serve a the initial step for following How-To videos. |
| [How-To: Blinking an LED with a GPIO](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=DKF1YvrLhaWjf46JiqFAvD&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | In this video we walk through developing a basic Blinky LED application using both the Hardware Abstraction Layer and the lower-level Peripheral Driver Libraries for PSoC™ 6. |
| [How-To: Blinking an LED with a PWM](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=Brc4rJquuXCJ5YZFTLwwtn&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | In this video we extend the concept of a Blinky LED with the capability of a hardware Timer/Counter/PWM peripheral. The walk through will illustrate using both the Hardware Abstraction Layer and the lower-level Peripheral Driver Libraries for PSoC™ 6. |
| [How-To: Using a GPIO interrupt](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=8BzX3rBcfUo3nxaQTeVGxc&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | In this video we walk through the development of an interrupt enabled GPIO button. The video illustrates the APIs and concepts with both the Hardware Abstraction Layer and the lower-level Peripheral Driver Libraries for PSoC™ 6. |
