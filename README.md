# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – PSoC™ MCUs

This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers PSoC™ 6 and PSoC™ 4 MCUs.

The material and examples demonstrate the use of peripherals such as GPIOs, PWMs, ADCs,
UARTs, etc. CAPSENSE™ and DMA are covered in detail, as is the use of low power modes and dual core.
